The program reads the finite state machine (without weights) from standard input. The machines does not contains epsilon-pass.

The deterministic equivalent of nondeterministic machine entered in the input is written as the output. This machine has states sorted by:
- the minimum distance from the initial state
- possibly the "low" (in ASCII code) label that labels the transition from the state closer to the initial state.

Transitions are sorted according to the sign they are labeled (according to ASCII codes).

The program does not check whether the text has been loaded from the standard input is the correct description of the machine.
