The program loads subsequent lines from the standard entry and analyze each line (without the end of the line) using regular expressions as much as possible.

For each inscription, program checks whether the given string is "NO" or "NO" in which "E" or "O" respectively occur at least 6 times, after there are at least 3 exclamation marks. If the subtitle fulfills this condition, please program writes to standard output 'true', otherwise - 'false'.
