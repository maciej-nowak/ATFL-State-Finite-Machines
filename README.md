# ATFL-State-Finite-Machines
State finite machines examples, thrax gramma and simple regex tasks. Created at the University as the project within Automata Theory and Formal Languages classes in 2014. The purpose of those examples was to learn automata and formal languages theory and also create simple state finite machines. 

## State finite machines
Example programs of [state finite machines](state_finite_machines) like converting nondeterministic to deterministic machine, is words acceptable by machine, program which counts passes in the machine. All programs take machine as input in specific given format.

## Thrax gramma
The program of a [thrax grammar](thrax_gramma) that converts numbers from a range from -999,999 from 999.999.

## Regular expressions
Example programs of regular expressions like validation or text converting.
